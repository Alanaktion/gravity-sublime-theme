# Gravity Theme

### A [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) UI theme. 

Created this UI theme using a port of the Default theme that comes with ST3. It was a great experence and I hope coders enjoy it as much as I have creating it. The goal was to make a dark theme that feels at home on the new Yosemite OSX.

The Gravity theme only works with Sublime Text 3, latest build. It hasn't been tested on earlier builds.


## Install using GIT

* Locate your Sublime Text **"Packages"** directory by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
* Load up that directory in Terminal app; for example: `cd /Users/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`
* Next, run this GIT command: `git clone git@github.com:frankyonnetti/gravity-sublime-theme.git"`
* Rename the folder to `Theme - Gravity`


## Install manually

* Use the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/frankyonnetti/gravity-sublime-theme/archive/master.zip) button from GitHub.
* Locate your Sublime Text **"Packages"** directory by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
* Unzip the archive and rename the folder `Theme - Gravity` and place it in the **"Packages"** directory.


## Activating the theme

* Open your setting by using the menu `Preferences > Settings - User`
* Add, or replace, the **"theme:"** settings with `"theme": "Gravity.sublime-theme"`


## Replacing the default "fold" icon

Currently the only way to override the default *code folding icon* with the one for Gravity, you have to place the `Theme - Default` directory in the **"Packages"** directory. The Gravity fold icon looks like: ![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yonnetti-sublime/gravity/fold.png)

* Download the [directory with icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yonnetti-sublime/gravity/Theme-Default.zip) separately and place it in the **"Packages"** directory.
* You can get there by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`


## Syntax Color Scheme

The syntax color scheme in each screenshot is a port of the Monokai-Sublime scheme created for Gravity.

Once you have Gravity installed, you can select the scheme by using the menu item `Preferences > Color Scheme > Theme - Gravity > Monokai Gravity (SL)`
