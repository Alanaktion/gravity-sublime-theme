# Gravity Theme

### A [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) UI theme. 

Created this UI theme using a port of the Default theme that comes with ST3. The goal was to make a dark and light theme that feels at home on Yosemite OSX.

Version 2.0 introduces the **Reverse Gravity** light theme.

The Gravity theme only works with Sublime Text 3, latest build. It hasn't been tested on earlier builds.

## Install using Package Control

If you're using [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net), you can easily install the Gravity theme by using the **Command Palette**:

* Go to `Tools > Command Palette...`
* Type `Package Control: Install Package`
* Search for `Theme - Gravity`


## Install using GIT

* Locate your Sublime Text **"Packages"** directory by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
* Load up that directory in Terminal app; for example: `cd /Users/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`
* Next, run this GIT command: `git clone git@github.com:frankyonnetti/gravity-sublime-theme.git"`
* Rename the folder to `Theme - Gravity`


## Install manually

* Use the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/frankyonnetti/gravity-sublime-theme/archive/master.zip) button from GitHub.
* Locate your Sublime Text **"Packages"** directory by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
* Unzip the archive and rename the folder `Theme - Gravity` and place it in the **"Packages"** directory.


## Activating the theme

* Open your settings by using the menu `Preferences > Settings - User`
* Add, or replace, the **"theme:"** settings with 
`"theme": "Gravity.sublime-theme"` or, 
`"theme": "Reverse Gravity.sublime-theme"`


**Applying the file Tab height option:** <span style="color:#fff;background-color:green;">&nbsp;new feature in 2.0.1&nbsp;</span>

* Open your settings (if not already open) by using the menu `Preferences > Settings - User`
* Add **one** of the two options:
`"tab_height_short": true` or, 
`"tab_height_tall": true`


## Replacing the default "fold" icon

Currently the only way to override the default *code folding icon* with the one for Gravity, you have to place the `Theme - Default` directory in the **"Packages"** directory. The Gravity fold icon looks like:

* Download the [directory with icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yonnetti-sublime/gravity/Theme-Default.zip) separately and place it in the **"Packages"** directory.
* You can get there by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`


## Syntax color scheme

The syntax color scheme in each screenshot is a port of the Monokai-Sublime scheme created for Gravity.

Once you have Gravity installed, you can select the scheme by using the menu item `Preferences > Color Scheme > Theme - Gravity > Monokai Gravity (SL)`

The font used for the syntax shown in the screenshot is `"font_face": "Monaco"` and `"font_size": 14`


## App icon

Download the [white and orange app icons](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yonnetti-sublime/gravity/Gravity-App-Icons-101.zip) (v.1.0.1) designed to fit in Yosemite's dock along with the other OSX (10.10) icons.

To install the white or orange app icon, select **Sublime Text** in your **Applications** folder. From the Finder menu, select `File > Get Info` and drag the .icns file on top of the default Sublime Text icon in the *Get Info window*.
