# Gravity Theme

### A [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) UI theme. 

Created this UI theme using a port of the Default theme that comes with ST3. It was a great experence and I hope coders enjoy it as much as I did creating it. The goal was to make a dark theme that feels at home on the new Yosemite OSX.

The Gravity theme only works with Sublime Text 3, latest build. It hasn't been tested on earlier builds.


## Install using GIT

* Locate your Sublime Text **"Packages"** directory by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
* Load up that directory in Termainal app; for example: `cd /Users/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`
* Next, run this GIT command: `git clone git@github.com:frankyonnetti/gravity-sublime-theme.git"`


## Install manually

* Use the [Download ZIP](https://github.com/frankyonnetti/gravity-sublime-theme/archive/master.zip) button from GitHub.
* Locate your Sublime Text **"Packages"** directory by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
* Unzip the archive and rename the folder `Theme - Gravity` and place it in the **"Packages"** directory.


## Activating the theme

* Open your setting by using the menu `Preferences > Settings - User`
* Add, or replace, the **"theme:"** settings with `"theme": "Gravity.sublime-theme"`


## Replacing the default "fold" icon

Currently the only way to override the default *code folding icon* with the one for Gravity you have to place the `Theme - Default` directory in the **"Packages"** directory.

* Download the [directory with icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yonnetti-sublime/gravity/Theme-Default.zip) separately and place it in the **"Packages"** directory.
* You can get there by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`

## Syntax Color Scheme

The Syntax Color Scheme in the screenshot is a port of Monokai-Sublime scheme.

* [Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yonnetti-sublime/gravity/Monokai-Gravity.zip)  the `Monokai Gravity (SL).tmTheme` color theme and place it in the **"Packages"** directory.
* Locate your Sublime Text **"Packages"** directory by using the menu item `Preferences > Browse Packages...`
